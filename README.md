# Solutions-CrackingTheCodingInterview-
Hi!
I am Asier Serrano, a sophomore student of Computer Science at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Valencia, Spain.
These are my solutions to problems I solve from the book Cracking The Coding Interview.
They are written in C++ mostly, except the ones belonging to the Java chapter.
I hope this helps you understand the book.
Enjoy coding!
